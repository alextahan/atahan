Hi! I am a second year Computer Science student at UC San Diego, in Warren College. 

In college, I've taken courses in:
```
Data Structures, Discrete Math, Linear Algebra, Algorithms, and Data Science
```
and I have programming experience in:

- Java
- Python
- JavaScript
- C
- C++
- Assembly
- and more!


I also have experience with web application development from an internship at the San Diego Supercomputer Center.

## About Me
I grew up in San Diego, CA. Located on the west coast, next to the Pacific Ocean, and bordering Mexico, it's the 8th most populous city in the US with a population of 1,386,932<sup>[1](#footnotes)</sup>!

### Education
I attended Canyon Crest Academy for high school.

### Interests

I enjoy walking and biking around San Diego. I also play piano and like ballroom dancing.

I have two cats: `Astro` and `Skyler`. They are both over 10 years old!
